    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Working with Prof. Naren Ramakrishnan's group to create an open-source library of epidemiological models for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic and the seasonal flu.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Research Assistant - BIST (Virginia Tech) \hfill Nov. 2019 - present (school year)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Working on a Center for Bioinspired Science and Technology project led by Prof. Rolf Mueller involving the use of bat-inspired biomimetic sonar and deep learning for robotic navigation in forested environments.
      %\item Previously used the DeepLabCut software package to track bats' movements in images. 
      \item Helped develop a ConvNet-based algorithm to identify the position of the sonar sensor within a forest area

    \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer Intern - Decipher Technology Studios \hfill 2018 - 2020 (summers)}
    \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Worked on a small team to develop Sense, a new product which provides deep reinforcement learning-powered predictive autoscaling for Decipherâ€™s service mesh platform
      \item Implemented a library of policy gradient, Q-Learning, and actor-critic approaches to deep reinforcement learning (DQN, DDPG, A2C, PPO, SAC, etc), as well as model improvements such as recurrent and convolutional layers, with PyTorch
      \item Wrote a microservice environment simulator for offline training with another intern and created a rule-based autoscaler to jumpstart training via imitation learning.
      %\item Added recurrent and convolutional layers to the neural networks to better leverage time-series data
      %\item Collected metrics using Prometheus and Gatling and tested various model architectures on the data
      \item Created infrastructure to deploy Sense as a service on Openshift and Elastic Kubernetes Service.
