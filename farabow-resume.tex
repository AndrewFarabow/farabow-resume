    \begin{compactitem}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Built a grid-based, OpenAI Gym-compatible simulation called SensorGrid that replicated key aspects of drone sensing and navigation challenges in a simplified environment, useful for testing reinforcement learning models before deployment to a more computationally-expensive environment, as part of the Raytheon RAAIDS project. 
      \item Currently preparing a manuscript (first author) for submission sometime in Summer 2022.
      \item Designed and trained a Resnet-based object-detecting convolutional neural network architecture, which achieved 97\% accuracy on the classification phase of the Lockheed Martin AlphaPilot Dataset. %and was deployed to a drone's computer to aid in navigation.
