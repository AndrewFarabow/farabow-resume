    \textbf{Research Assistant - Sanghani Center (Virginia Tech) \hfill May. 2021 - present}
    \begin{compactitem}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Spearheading the effort to create an open-source library of epidemiological models for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic and the seasonal flu, under the direction of Prof. Naren Ramakrishnan.
      \item Utilized object-oriented design to maximize code reuse and simplify the creation of new models and datasets, wrote tests in PyTest, and created online documentation.
      \item Implemented compartmental, classical time-series, and machine learning models, as well as a range of datasets and evaluation metrics.
    \end{compactitem}

    \textbf{Research Assistant - BIST (Virginia Tech) \hfill Nov. 2019 - present (school year)}
    \begin{compactitem}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Working on a Center for Bioinspired Science and Technology project, led by Prof. Rolf Mueller, involving the use of bat-inspired biomimetic sonar and deep learning for robotic navigation in forested environments.
      %\item Previously used the DeepLabCut software package to track bats' movements in images. 
      \item Helped develop a ConvNet-based algorithm to identify the position of the sonar sensor within a forest area
    \end{compactitem}

    \textbf{Research Assistant - Hume Center (Virginia Tech) \hfill Sept. 2019 - present (school year)}
    \begin{compactitem}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Applying reinforcement learning algorithms to simulations designed to mimic defense systems as part of a Raytheon-Virginia Tech partnership.
      \item Previously designed and trained object-detecting convolutional neural network architectures, which achieved 97\% accuracy on the classification phase of the Lockheed Martin AlphaPilot Dataset and were deployed to a drone's computer to aid in navigation.
      \item Participating in the IC CAE Scholars Program, which involves conducting research with the Hume Center, participating in a number of events (seminars, workshops, etc) and presenting results at a yearly colloquium.
    \end{compactitem}

    \textbf{Machine Learning Engineer Intern - Decipher Technology Studios \hfill 2018 - 2020 (summers)}
    \begin{compactitem}
      \itemsep0em
      \item Worked on a small team to develop Sense, a product which uses deep reinforcement learning to control the resources allocated to a microservice, striking a balance between server performance and hosting cost (predictive autoscaling).
      \item Implemented a library of policy gradient, Q-Learning, and actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, DDPG, A2C, PPO, SAC, etc) in PyTorch.
      \item Wrote a microservice environment simulator for offline training and built a Sense microservice for online training and deployment (on Openshift and Elastic Kubernetes Service).
      \item Added recurrent and convolutional layers to the neural networks to better leverage autocorrelation within the data.
      %\item Collected metrics using Prometheus and Gatling and tested various model architectures on the data
      \item Contributed to a related project called the Sense Log Anomaly Detector (LAD), which uses a recurrent autoencoder to identify anomalous log lines. Worked on improving the autoencoder by adding a self-attention mechanism.
    \end{compactitem}
